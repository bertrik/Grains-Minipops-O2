# Status
This is not a finished piece of work, it is working but under constuction.
It has been developed on a Grains V1, and after a bit of configuration also for V2. Please read the code...


# Simple user manual:
Knob 1 selects the drumpattern, input 1 can be used when Knob 1 is maxed or set to taste

Knob 2 selects the mute of the individual drums in a binary fashion. Input 2 can be used, when Knob 2 is maxed or set to taste.

# Grains V1
Knob 3 is a attenuator for the Trigger input, nice to stop the machine midways,
Input 3 is then trigger input. In standalone mode (see config) Knob 3 sets the tempo.

# Grains V2
Knob 3 doesn't do anything, but sitting there being pretty.  In standalone mode (see config) Knob 3 sets the tempo.
Input 3 is then trigger input. In standalone mode (see config) Knopb 3 sets the tempo.

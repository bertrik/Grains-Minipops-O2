Minipops O2 for Ginko Synthese Grains

# What is it
Minipops O2 is a sample-based simulation of the Korg Minipops7. You can find all the info in the link to the Minipops O2 project.
Here you find a port to Ginko Synthese Grains

# Status
This is not a finished piece of work, it is working but under constuction.
It has been developed on a Grains V1, and only working on a V1. 
Code cleanup has to be done, but I think you would like it anyway.

# Simple user manual:
Knob 1 selects the mute of the individual drums in a binary fashion. Input 1 can be used, when Knob 1 is maxed.
Knob 2 selects the drumpattern, again input 2 can be used when Knob 2 is maxed
Knob 3 is a attenuator for the Trigger input, nice to stop the machine midways,
Input 3 is the trigger input.

# Thanks to
Jan Ostman for writing the original code.
Jorge Guti√©rrez for rewriting the code: he built a version that can use an external clock.
